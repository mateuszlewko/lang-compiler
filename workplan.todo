❑ 1. Finish partial application (currying)

❑ 2. Fix nested functions (lambda lifting + closure conversion)

❑ 3a. Improve parsing (as in F# 4.0)
❑ 3b. Records
❑ 3c. Mutually recursive functions

❑ 5a. Type checking / simple type inference 
❑ 5b. Let-polymorphism

❑ 6a. Type classes 
❑ 6b. Type inference with type classes

Maybe:
    ❑ Reference type, var
    ❑ Lambda-exprs
    ❑ Pattern matching, Union type
